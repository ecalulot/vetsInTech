# ITP Week 2 Day 2 (In-Class) Practice 2

# Creating and Calling Functions

# Create a function called greetings that prints "Hello World!"
def greetings():
    print("Hello World!")

# Call greetings and run this Python file
howdy = greetings()

# Create a function called add_num: 
def add_num(x, y):
    print(x + y) 

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 5 to x and 7 to y
# print the sum of x and y
simple_add = add_num(5, 7) # 12

# Call your function

# Create a function called subtract_num:
def sub_num(x, y):
    print(x - y)

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 10 to x and 3 to y
# print the difference of x and y

# Call your function
simple_sub = sub_num(10, 3) # 7

# Create a function called multiply_num:
def multiply_num(x, y):
    print(x * y)

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 5 to x and 7 to y
# print the product of x and y

# Call your function
product_of_num = multiply_num(5, 7)

# Create a function called divide_num:
def divide_num(x, y):
    print(x / y)

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 10 to x and 2 to y
# print the quotient of x divided by y

# Call your function
simple_division = divide_num(10, 2)
